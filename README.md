This is a simple webpage that provides an outline for learning the Java programming language. The webpage has four sections: Introduction, Basics, Intermediate and Advanced. Each section provides an overview of the topics that will be covered in that section. The webpage also has a navigation menu with links to each section. Additionally, there is a toggle button that when clicked switches between light and dark theme. The theme is changed by adding or removing a class called "dark-theme" from the body element using JavaScript.
